# SharpDXFramework

SharpDXFramework is a hobby project and a .NET based toolkit-engine for quickly getting up and running,
whether you need to make a game or simply have high-performance screen rendering.
It is written in C# and uses the managed .NET DirectX wrapper [SharpDX](http://sharpdx.org/), for high performance rendering.
